## Values

The [TODO: PROJECTNAME] and its leadership embrace the following values:

- Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the [open and is discoverable](https://github.com/orgs/The-Mycelium-Network/discussions) for future reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public forums and open repositories. In all things we embrace a [remote first culture](https://blog.doist.com/remote-first/#remote-first).

- Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit
  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

- Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes
  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals. Each
  contributor participates in the project as an individual.

- Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which
  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment. Ensure that
  your are familiar with and agree to our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

- Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through
  participation, and there is a clear path up the [contributor ladder](CONTRIBUTOR_ROLES.md)
  into leadership positions.

## Maintainers

[TODO: PROJECTNAME] Maintainers have write access to the [GitHub repository](TODO).
They can merge their own patches ([within reason](REVIEWING.md#maintainer-edge-cases)) or patches from others. Current maintainers
are part of the Mycelium Network [core team](https://github.com/orgs/The-Mycelium-Network/teams/tmn-core). Maintainers collectively manage the project's resources and contributors.

This privilege is granted with some [expectation of responsibility](CONTRIBUTOR_ROLES.md#maintainer-requirements): maintainers
are people who care about the [TODO: PROJECTNAME] project and want to help it grow and improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping the project succeed.

## Becoming a Maintainer

For details on the different roles and how to become a maintainer, see the [contributor roles](CONTRIBUTOR_ROLES.md) document.

## Meetings

Time zones permitting, Maintainers are expected to participate in the public community meeting, which occurs monthly.

Maintainers will also have closed meetings to discuss security reports or Code of Conduct violations. Any Maintainer can schedule such a meeting on receipt of a security issue or code of conduct report. All current Maintainers must be invited to such closed sessions, except for any Maintainer accused of a code of conduct violation.

## Mycelium Network Resources

Any Maintainer may make a request for Mycelium Network resources during a meeting. A majority vote is needed to approve such a request. Maintainers should always consider the available budget and [current and future planned expenses](https://opencollective.com/the-mycelium-network#category-BUDGET).

## Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations by community members will be discussed and resolved during the afore mentioned closed sessions. If the reported code of conduct violator is a Maintainer, the Maintainers will not be invited to the closed session.

## Voting

While most business in [TODO: PROJECTNAME] is conducted by ["lazy consensus"](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html), periodically the Maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes. All voting will happen [via a poll](https://github.com/orgs/The-Mycelium-Network/discussions/categories/polls) using the organization-wide discussions on GitHub.

Most votes require a simple majority of all Maintainers to succeed. Maintainers can be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of all Maintainers, and changes to this Governance document require a 2/3 vote of all Maintainers.

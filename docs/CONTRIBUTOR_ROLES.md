### Contributor privileges

- Invitation to contributor events.
- Eligibility to become an organization member.
- Will be added to the [contributors team](/teams/contributors.md).

## Organization member

An Organization Member is an established contributor who regularly participates in the project. Organization Members have privileges on the organization level and, as such, are expected to act in the interests of the whole project.

### Requirements to become an organization member

Meet one or more of the following requirements on a monthly basis:

- Two or more accepted pull requests.
- Reviewed three or more pull requests.
- Resolved two or more issues.
- Must have been contributing for at least two months.
- Must be actively contributing to at least one project area.
- Must have two sponsors who are also Organization Members.
- Have two factor authentication enabled for their GitHub account.
- Have enabled [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

#### Process for nominating an Organization Member

- The nominator will open a pull request using the appropriate [template](../templates/nominate-org-member.md) against the [Mycelium Network repository](https://github.com/The-Mycelium-Network/the-mycelium-network).
- The nominee will add a comment to the pull request agreeing to all responsibilities of becoming an Organization Member.
- To be accepted, the pull request needs two approvals. This can be any combination of Organization Members, Invited Experts, or Maintainers.
- Once the pull request is approved, the new Organization Member is added to the [organizations-members team](/teams/org-members.md).

An Organization Member must meet these requirements and has the responsibilities of a Contributor.

### Organization member privileges

- May be assigned issues and reviews.
- Will be added to the [organizations-members team](/teams/org-members.md).
- Can recommend other contributors to become Orginization Members.

## Maintainer

Maintainers are established contributors or project founders who are responsible for the entire project. As such, they have the ability to approve pull requests against any area of the project, and are expected to participate in making decisions about the strategy and priorities of the project.

### Maintainer requirements

- Demonstrates a broad knowledge of the project across multiple areas.
- Is able to exercise judgment for the good of the project, independent of the influence of other members or partners.
- A history of mentoring other contributors.
- Can commit to spending at least 16 hours per month working on the project.

#### Process for nominating a maintainer

- The nominator will open a pull request using the appropriate [template](../templates/nominate-maintainer.md) against the [Mycelium Network repository](https://github.com/The-Mycelium-Network/the-mycelium-network).
- The nominee will add a comment to the pull request agreeing to all responsibilities of becoming a Maintainer.
- At least one current Maintainers must approve the pull request.
- Once the pull request is approved, the new maintainer is added to the [maintainer team](../teams/maintainers.md).

### Maintainer responsibilities

A Maintainer is responsible for the same responsibilities of all other roles as well as:

- Determining strategy and policy for the project.
- Participating in, and leading, community meetings.
- Mentoring new and existing contributors across all other roles.
- If appropriate, based on the skill set of the maintainer:
  - Propose, approve, or implement design and UX improvements.
  - Propose, approve, or implement code and infrastructure improvements.
  - Propose, approve, or implement content improvements.
  - Propose, approve, or implement process improvements.

## Invited experts

Invited experts are responsible for a specific topic area or project component smaller than an entire project. Invited experts are automatically assigned for review when pull requests are opened in their topic area. If there is more than one topic expert, reviewers are assigned using a [load-balancing strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team#about-auto-assignment).

Invited experts have a track record of contributions, participation, and reviews in the project or organization. Invited experts can also be invited to act as a knowledgeable resource for the project.

### Invited experts requirements

- Demonstrates an in-depth knowledge of the specific area.
- Commits to being responsible for their assigned topic area.
- Is supportive of new and occasional contributors and helps to get pull requests ready to merge.
- Attends the monthly [community meeting](https://www.meetup.com/the-mycelium-network-meetups/).

#### Process for nominating an Invited Expert

- Invited experts will be nominated during the maintainer meeting and will be contacted via email.
- Once the nomination is accepted, the invited expert will be added to the [invited-experts team](/teams/invited-experts.md).

### Invited experts responsibilities

In addition to the rights and responsibilities of an Organization Member, Invited experts are responsible for:

- Following the [review guide](REVIEWING.md).
- Reviewing most pull requests in their topic area.
- Helping other contributors become reviewers.

### Invited experts privileges

- Have commit access to the repository.
- Can recommend and vote for other members to become Organization Members and Invited experts.
- Will be added to the invited experts team.

## Community manager

The community manager role is distinct in many respects. Still, as the projects are technical, the role shares many of the same requirements and responsibilities as the maintainer role.

In addition to the responsibilities of a maintainer, the community manager has these additional responsibilities.

- Address reports where the code of conduct has been violated and decide on the appropriate action.
- Organize and run community events.
- Determine media strategies to promote the project and onboard new contributors and users.
- Define and implement the onboarding experience.
- Organize community-related project meetings.
- Meet with and ensure a healthy relationship with contributors and partners.
- Assist with issue triage as well as pull request review where appropriate.
- Responsible for monitoring all communication channels, including discussions on GitHub.
- Highlight contributors that have done exceptional work and/or have shown dedication to the project and organization.
- Ensure the health and well-being of the project and all participants.
- Identify and assist with the implementation of automation to improve project sustainability.

> NOTE: If the project does not have a dedicated community manager, the responsibilities can be shared by the project maintainers.

## Inactivity

Participants must be active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Conversely, inactivity harms the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a loss of trust in the project.

Inactivity is measured by:

- Periods of no contributions for longer than three months.
- Periods of no communication for longer than a month.

Consequences of being inactive include:

- Involuntary removal or demotion.
- Being asked to move to Emeritus status.

### Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, or a violation of the Code of Conduct. This process is essential because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opening up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

During a maintainers meeting, a participant can ask to demote or remove a contributor. In addition, the participant is responsible for adding supporting information to the meeting agenda. Finally, the matter will be discussed and brought to a vote by all maintainers and community managers.

Please communicate with the maintainers to avoid the above process should your time commitments change. In these cases, you can instead proactively choose to step down for a while or move to Emeritus status (see below).

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process

If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to Emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.

A Discord server for early-stage web developers to learn and share together. The focus of the community is learning how to build performance, accessible experiences for the web. While we will, from time to time, cover common, widely used frameworks, our focus is on the open web platform. This means that we focus on native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
